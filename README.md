# 🎨 Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas

## 📋 Overview

The **Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas** is a multi-user web application that allows multiple participants to **draw simultaneously on the same canvas** with **real-time synchronization**.  
It demonstrates strong fundamentals in HTML5 Canvas manipulation, WebSocket communication, and collaborative state management — all **without using frontend frameworks or external drawing libraries**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🖌️ Drawing Tools
- Brush and eraser functionality  
- Adjustable stroke width and color palette  
- Smooth, pressure-free drawing paths  

### 🌐 Real-Time Collaboration
- Live synchronization of strokes between connected clients  
- User cursor indicators showing drawing positions  
- Overlap handling for concurrent drawing  

### 🔄 Global Undo / Redo
- Shared undo/redo history across all users  
- Stack-based operation management  
- Maintains consistent canvas state  

### 👥 User Management
- Shows list of connected users  
- Assigns unique color to each user  
- Tracks user join/leave events in real time  

### ⚙️ Backend Functionality
- WebSocket (or Socket.io) based event broadcasting  
- Room-based canvas session handling  
- Synchronization and conflict management

## 🧠 Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Vanilla JavaScript / TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js, WebSockets / Socket.io |
| **Data Protocol** | JSON-based event messages |
| **No Frameworks** | No React, Vue, Angular, etc. |
| **No Drawing Libraries** | Pure Canvas API only |

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/collaborative-canvas.git
cd collaborative-canvas
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 4️⃣ Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 5️⃣ Test Multi-User Collaboration

Open multiple tabs or browsers — each one represents a different user drawing in real-time.

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. Run the backend server (`npm start`).
2. Open two or more browser windows.
3. Draw on one canvas — observe real-time updates on all others.
4. Test **Undo/Redo** to confirm synchronized history.
5. Observe live user cursors and connection status.

---

## 🧱 Known Limitations

* Undo/Redo synchronization may desync on poor network connections.
* Canvas state not persistent (refresh clears all drawings).
* Limited handling for overlapping strokes during heavy concurrency.
* No authentication or user persistence after reload.

## 🕒 Time Spent

| Task                          | Duration    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Canvas Drawing Implementation | 5 hrs       |
| WebSocket Backend Setup       | 4 hrs       |
| Real-Time Sync Logic          | 6 hrs       |
| Undo/Redo & State Management  | 5 hrs       |
| Testing & Debugging           | 3 hrs       |
| Documentation                 | 2 hrs       |
| **Total**                     | **~25 hrs** |

## 📘 Documentation Reference

Refer to [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for:

* Detailed data flow diagram
* WebSocket message protocol structure
* Undo/Redo synchronization strategy
* Performance and concurrency handling decisions
* Conflict resolution mechanism


## 🎯 Bonus Points (Optional)

* ✍️ **Touchscreen support** for mobile/tablet
* 🏠 **Room-based canvases** for separate sessions
* 💾 **Canvas persistence** (save & reload drawings)
* ⚡ **Performance metrics** (FPS counter, latency display)
* 🎨 **Creative tools** (shapes, text insertion, layers)


## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Add persistent sessions (Redis/MongoDB)
* Implement advanced stroke conflict resolution
* Add in-app chat for collaboration
* Add shape tools and layer-based editing
* Replay or time-lapse of drawing history

## 🏁 Final Notes

This assignment tests **real-time systems thinking**, **canvas fluency**, and **collaborative architecture**.
Focus on:

* Smooth, consistent real-time drawing
* Clean code and modular design
* Graceful handling of concurrency

Deliver it like a production-grade mini-app — stable, optimized, and elegant. 🚀
